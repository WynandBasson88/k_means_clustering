# k_means_clustering
## What the k_means_clustering project is for
The k_means_clustering project was created using Python. This project enables the user to do the following:
* Apply an Unsupervised Machine Learning model to a data set
* Specify the number of clusters (k) to be depicted when plotting the results
* Specify the number of iterations (n) the K-Means Clustering algorithm should run for
* Observe in the results plotted how the clusters converge with every iteration of applying the K-Means Clustering algorithm on a data set

The goal of this project was to better understand the K-Means Clustering algorithm that can be applied to different data sets using the Python programming language. This project can be used by any person interested in Unsupervised Machine Learning.
